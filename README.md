# process-tree
Given two values h and n, where h is the height of the process tree and n is the degree of each process node,
a process tree is created. The child process ID and the respective parent process ID is printed for easy
verification.

Since this code is OS based, running this in Windows without an installed Virtual Machine will show errors and
is suggested to run on LINUX systems or in VM's.
